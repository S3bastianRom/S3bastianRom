## Projects
Here are some of my projects, I divided them into sections based on the project context and general goal:


🐍 Python
- **[Andes University](https://github.com/S3bastianRom/Andes-Projects)**: In this Python course we started from the basic POO model passing to MVC model and after that we moved to libraries such as Flask to create a whole web app with layers of testing security and API's deployments.
